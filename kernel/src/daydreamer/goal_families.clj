  "Per-family activation rules and plan bodies.

  Wave 2 starts with REVERSAL because it exercises the context machinery that
  the Python scheduler does not have: copying an old planning state, attaching
  it as a pseudo-sprout under a new branch, clearing emotional residue, and
  rebinding surviving plan structure to a new top-level goal.

  This namespace implements that first kernel. It does not attempt Mueller's
  full search over failure leafs yet; it provides the alternative-past branch
  primitive that later goal-family plans can call."
